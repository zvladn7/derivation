# Derivation - course work c++
 The application can calculate the derivative of a particular value of x
 Allowed operations: +, -, *, ^
 To enter an expression you can use:
   1. Your keybord
   2. Application's button
# Operation that can be used:
   1. +, -, *, ^ (degree)
   2. AC - clear field for entering an expression
   3. Get result - estimate polynomial derivative in concrete value of x
 The coefs of polynomial are only real type
